    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy pasta dish that makes use of any leftover veggies you <br>
         may have on hand. You can increase, decrease, or sub out any veggies <br>
         you wish. Some excellent additions to this recipe would be bell peppers, <br>
         mushrooms, olives, zucchini, cauliflower--the possibilities are endless! <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound thin spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 cup baby spinach, rinsed and dried</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped broccoli</li> 
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>   
        <li>1 carrot, grated</li>   
        <li>½ red onion, thinly sliced</li>   
        <li>½ cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced</li>     
        <li>4 ounces crumbled goat cheese, or to taste  </li>      
        <li> ¼ cup toasted sliced almonds, or to taste </li>     
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together white wine vinegar, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, <br>
             Italian seasoning, honey, garlic, Dijon mustard, basil, salt, and pepper <br>
             in a small bowl until well combined. Gradually mix in olive oil, whisking constantly. <br>
             Set dressing aside.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
            Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, <br>
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. <br>
        </li>
        <li>While spaghetti cook, prepare all the vegetables. 
            Combine spinach, broccoli, peas, carrot, red onion, 
            cucumber, and tomato in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain pasta, and add to the bowl with the vegetables. <br>
            Toss pasta and veggies together. Pour dressing over pasta 
            and veggies and toss until thoroughly combined. <br>
            Add in goat cheese and almonds and toss again to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover pasta, and chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours to overnight. <br>
            Taste pasta salad, and season with more salt and pepper, if necessary.
        </li>
    </ol>
